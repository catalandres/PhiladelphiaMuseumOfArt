Thanks to the Philadelphia Museum of Art for inspiring their visitors to discover the spirit of imagination that lies in everyone, and for connecting all Philadelphians from near and far with an outstanding art collection.

### Inspiration

Here are some questions you may want to answer:

* An analysis of all the works by geography
* A time series tracking how donations have evolved over time (`geography`, `medium`, etc.)
* An analysis of the content in the `credit_line` field:
    * Analyze the more frequent forms of donation
    * Carry out a social network analysis to determine the most influential donors
* A study of the different support media in the collection (`medium`)

### Code

We have decoupled data collection (`PMA-download.py`) from dataset synthesizing (`PMA-synthesize.py`) to allow for separate testing. The download process can take several hours to complete. The code uses files on disk for backup purposes, so that the PMA's webserver will not be hit with redundant requests: once information about an artist or a work is collected, it should never be collected again, unless the corresponding local file is deleted.

Once the dataset is collected, is up to the user to delete any intermediate local files.

### Dataset

* The folder `results` contains the dataset in CSV format, broken down in chunks of 10K records for manageability.
* The folders `artists` and `works` contain the intermediate files corresponding to artists and works, respectively.
