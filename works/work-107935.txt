<div id="recordData"><p><i><strong>Woven Textile</strong></i></p><p>"Naturalistic" silk with architectural vignettes; large, squarish fragment formed from two pieced lengths, sewn together along the selvedges (rings at the top).  Double vertical rows of repeating motif of a naturalistically rendered "island" of a small castle's ruins and a millhouse on either side of a stream with a small tree with bushy tiers of foliage and large fruits, resting upon a cluster of disproportionately large fruit and leafy flower vines (rendered larger than lifesize), and overshadowed by a similarly large curving stem with leaves, taller fruits and two large multi-petalled flowers, the motifs being fairly closely spaced so that the very edges touch.</p><p>Artist/maker unknown, French</p><p></p><div align="left" style="padding-bottom:6px; padding-top:14px; border-top:1px
