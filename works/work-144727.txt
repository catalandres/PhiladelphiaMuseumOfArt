<div id="recordData"><p><i><strong>La Cité de Dieu (The City of God)</strong></i></p><p>The book <i>La Cité de Dieu</i> is a work of theology describing the City of God and the City of the Pagans. On folio 5 (the second image), The City of God, in the upper left, is filled with church spires and angels. The City of Pagans, below, is inhabited by flying demons and round-domed structures. A battle between the two cities is depicted on the right. God rules heaven while devils stoke a cauldron in hell. This luxurious copy of Augustine's <i>La Cité de Dieu</i> may have belonged to the famous fifteenth-century bibliophile, Jean, duke of Berry.</p><p>Orosius Master and Assistants, French (active Paris), from 1400 - 1418. Written by Saint Augustine.</p><p></p><div align="left" style="padding-bottom:6px; padding-top:14px; border-top:1px
