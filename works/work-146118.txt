<div id="recordData"><p><i><strong>Woman's Two-Piece Day Dress: Bodice and Skirt</strong></i></p><p>Worth used a brightly brocaded floral silk to soften the austerity of the black silk faille. Curved seams give the bodice an hourglass shape, which is accented by satin-edged triangular inserts of the brocade at front and back.  Full hips are enhanced by a puffed overskirt, bordered in front by iridescent beaded fringe over the brocade center panel. The floral fabric is most dramatic down the back of the skirt, where it emerges from under the bodice's bustle tails to flow into a graceful train.</p><p>Designed by Charles Frederick Worth, English (active Paris), 1825 - 1895</p><p></p><div align="left" style="padding-bottom:6px; padding-top:14px; border-top:1px
