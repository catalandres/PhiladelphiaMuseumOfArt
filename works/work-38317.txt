<div id="recordData"><p><i><strong>Temple Hanging</strong></i></p><p>Two heavenly musicians float above the clouds; the figure on the left plays a guitar-like instrument and the one on the right, a reed organ; they are flanked by a seven-string lute and pipe. This triangular hanging was used by the Tendai sect, an eclectic form of Buddhism of Chinese origin that was introduced into Japan in the eighth century, to cover the shelf that stands in front of the temple's main statue of the Buddha.</p><p>Artist/maker unknown, Japanese</p><p></p><div align="left" style="padding-bottom:6px; padding-top:14px; border-top:1px
