<div id="recordData"><p><i><strong>Printed Textile: "Les Monuments de Paris"</strong></i></p><p>This furnishing fabric was designed by the prominent architect Hippolyte Le Bas, one of several well-known artists who worked for the factory; his drawing was engraved onto a copper roller for printing onto the cotton by Nicolas Auguste Leisnier.  The composition, which is typical of the early nineteenth-century Neoclassical style, shows a repeat of four elaborately framed scenes of Parisian monuments: to the left, the statue of Henri IV and the Pont Neuf with the Pantheon; to the right, the Fontaine des Innocents with the Louvre.  Each vignette is connected to a medallion portrait of the sovereign who reigned when the monuments were erected.</p><p>Designed by Louis Hippolyte Lebas, French, 1782 - 1867. Manufactured by Oberkampf, Jouy-en-Josas, France, 1760 - 1843. Engraved by Nicolas Auguste Leisnier, French, 1789 - 1862.</p><p></p><div align="left" style="padding-bottom:6px; padding-top:14px; border-top:1px
