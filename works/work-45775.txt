<div id="recordData"><p><i><strong>Quilt</strong></i></p><p>The central floral arrangement of this quilt has been cut from a variety of chintz fabrics, while the openwork basket is constructed from narrow strips of fabric. The fabrics date from between 1825 and 1840, with the majority purchased specifically for the quilt.  The edges of the cut pieces of fabric were turned under and then whipstitched in place.
