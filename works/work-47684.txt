<div id="recordData"><p><i><strong>Botanical Album Quilt</strong></i></p><p>This quilt is a variation of the traditional Baltimore album quilt in which blocks were appliquéd to suggest pages from one of the pictorial, remembrance, or autograph albums that were popular in mid-nineteenth century America.  Here, where the inspiration was a botanical publication, skilled needlework is combined with the contemporary interest in flower painting and botanical subjects.  As in other Baltimore album quilts, many of the flowers are three-dimensional constructions of layers of English and French block- and roller-printed textiles, with baskets "woven" from strips of fabric.</p><p>Made by Cinthia Arsworth, American</p><p></p><div align="left" style="padding-bottom:6px; padding-top:14px; border-top:1px
