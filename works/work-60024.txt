<div id="recordData"><p><i><strong>Noh Robe (Uwagi)</strong></i></p><p>The term karaori (literally "Chinese weaving") is applied to an intricate weave type in which untwisted silk wefts float across the surface of a fabric, giving the impression of elaborate embroidery. Noh robes woven with this technique are also known as karaori and are generally worn as an outer garment for female roles. They are stiff and heavy and give a regal effect appropriate for the slow and considered movements of Noh drama. This robe's wisteria and lattice motif is typical of karaori's "feminine" pictorial patterns; the use of red indicates that the robe was intended for roles portraying young women.</p><p>Artist/maker unknown, Japanese</p><p></p><div align="left" style="padding-bottom:6px; padding-top:14px; border-top:1px
