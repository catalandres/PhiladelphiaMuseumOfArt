<div id="recordData"><p><i><strong>Gala Ensemble for a Woman from Baranello, Molise, Italy</strong></i></p><p>Gala ensemble for special events such as Sundays, festivals, weddings, and even burial.  The costume itself reflects the wearer's social position.  The headdress was worn only by a married woman, as were the fringed belt and lowered bodice front; the lavish jewelry (here reproduction) and elaborate ornament, such as that on the apron, were used to demonstrate wealth.  The shape of the apron, a folded, flat rectangle under a brilliantly colored tie, shows off the borders of figured silk ribbon and the embroidery, which includes birds and flowers around a vase, a symbol of riches.</p><p>Artist/maker unknown, Italian</p><p></p><div align="left" style="padding-bottom:6px; padding-top:14px; border-top:1px
