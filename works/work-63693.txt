<div id="recordData"><p><i><strong>Kimono Fragment</strong></i></p><p>Design of shells and their cases (shell-matching game).  The game of shell matching (kai awase) has its origins with the aristocratic ladies of the ninth and tenth centuries. Essentially a test of memory, the insides of two half-shells are painted with an identical scene from Japanese classical literature (a full set consists of 360 pieces). Then, one of each matched pair is placed face down on the floor. The remaining shells are removed from their cases face up and players take turns turning over the face-down shells to find a match.</p><p>Artist/maker unknown, Japanese</p><p></p><div align="left" style="padding-bottom:6px; padding-top:14px; border-top:1px
