<div id="recordData"><p><i><strong>Woman's Bonnet</strong></i></p><p>Bonnets such as this, which had been adapted from stylish headwear of the early nineteenth century, were by mid-century identifiably Quaker.  Subtle variations in color and form manifested doctrinal differences:  the rigid pleating on this plain bonnet rather than soft gathers indicates the wearer's orthodoxy.  Always worn over a fine lawn cap, the bonnet was often protected by an oilskin cover in wet weather while a quilted silk cover could add warmth in winter.</p><p>Artist/maker unknown, American, Quaker. Worn by Mrs. Benjamin Maule (Margaret Evans), American (Quaker), 1806 - 1856.</p><p></p><div align="left" style="padding-bottom:6px; padding-top:14px; border-top:1px
