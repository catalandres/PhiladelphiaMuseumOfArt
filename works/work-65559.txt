<div id="recordData"><p><i><strong>Woven Textile (silk with bizarre design)</strong></i></p><p>"Bizarre" design representing an underwater fantasy, consisting of double vertical rows of serpentine, branching bands with occasional abstract and diapered shapes along the "trunks," framing a group of abstracted, rock-like shapes, from which sprout long, curved, spiky leaves and a thick stem intertwining with the wider bands, branching exotic flowers, fruits, leaves and shells; the entire pattern echoed and complimented by the ground patterning.  Four pieced lengths, sewn together along the selvedges to form a large rectangle, edged with gilded metal and yellow silk galloon trim (1 3/4 inches wide with a repeating leaf and flower design), backed with red plain weave silk taffeta.</p><p>Artist/maker unknown, Italian?</p><p></p><div align="left" style="padding-bottom:6px; padding-top:14px; border-top:1px
