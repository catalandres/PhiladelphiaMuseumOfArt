</strong><br/>Kitsuke (inner garment for male role)</i></p><p>The term atsuita, which originally referred to a weaving technique that produces various heavy brocades, is also applied to a type of inner robe used for a wide variety of male roles in Noh drama. These robes are commonly produced with fabric woven by the atsuita method, but can also be made of other cloths. Atsuita robes are worn beneath broad-sleeved jackets or cloaks and often feature strong colors and dynamic patterns, including stripes and checks. These simply patterned fabrics are the nearest Noh costumes come to traditional everyday Japanese dress, but they nevertheless exhibit the fine materials and workmanship of all Noh garments.</p><p>Artist/maker unknown, Japanese</p><p></p><div align="left" style="padding-bottom:6px; padding-top:14px; border-top:1px
