<div id="recordData"><p><i><strong>Sunburst Quilt</strong></i></p><p>The quilt contains almost four thousand diamond-shaped pieces, each about four inches long, that were first basted to a paper template to ensure uniformity of size before being meticulously whip-stitched together.  At least thirty-four different small-patterned, roller-printed cottons are used to form the octagonal rings that radiate from a central eight-pointed star to create a striking dark and light design.</p><p>Made by Rebecca Scattergood Savery, American, 1770 - 1855</p><p></p><div align="left" style="padding-bottom:6px; padding-top:14px; border-top:1px
