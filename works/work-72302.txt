<div id="recordData"><p><i><strong>Noh Robe (Uwagi)</strong></i></p><p>Chrysanthemums have many meanings and associations in Japan, including long life and prosperity. This robe is punctuated by full-faced chrysanthemums embroidered and accented with glistening gold threads, which are stylized to appear almost crestlike.  The fabric of the robe is enlivened with a monochromatic key-fret pattern produced by a compound satin weave. This lustrous, soft, figured satin suited the relaxed silhouette of fashionable kosode (small-sleeved kimonos) during the Edo period, and was used occasionally for Noh costumes.
