<div id="recordData"><p><i><strong>Bedcover</strong></i></p><p>The design of this bedcover is organized around a central medallion set within a large rectangular panel surrounded by wide borders. The figure of Touch, represented as a woman petting a small animal, is shown at the center, while female figures in the corners personify the other four senses: Smell, Hearing, Sight, and Taste.  Each is dressed in a combination of Indo-Persian and European costumes and hairstyles that date to about 1630-40.  The borders are populated by animals in chase and combat, a motif common to both sixteenth-century Persian carpets and seventeenth-century Mughal examples.  Above and below the central medallion are two pairs of the fantastic simurgh, the magic bird of the Persian national epic, the Shah-nama.</p><p>Artist/maker unknown, Indian, for export to the Portuguese market</p><p></p><div align="left" style="padding-bottom:6px; padding-top:14px; border-top:1px
