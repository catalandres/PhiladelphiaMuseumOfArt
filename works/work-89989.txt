<div id="recordData"><p><i><strong>Fisherman's Celebratory Robe (Maiwai)</strong></i></p><p>This fisherman's ceremonial robe is adorned with written characters that mean "ten thousand" and "celebration." The motifs and vivid colors express the intended festive use of the garment. A crane, which symbolizes good luck, descends towards the horizon holding a banner with the celebration character; folding fans, which are also symbols of a prosperous and happy fortune, bear the name of a ship and the word tairyo, meaning great fish catch.</p><p>Artist/maker unknown, Japanese</p><p></p><div align="left" style="padding-bottom:6px; padding-top:14px; border-top:1px
