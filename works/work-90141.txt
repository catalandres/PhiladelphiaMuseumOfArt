<div id="recordData"><p><i><strong>Woman's Stomacher and Collar</strong></i></p><p>This stomacher has an unusual matching collar to frame the neckline and further emphasize the taper of the torso.  The pictorial motifs on the stomacher and collar are the height of Rococo refinement.  In the asymmetrically placed main scene, a sheep sits contentedly as a shepherdess crowns her gallant with a floral wreath.  An abundance of fruit and flowers and a tiny out-of-scale building add to the idyllic fantasy.</p><p>Artist/maker unknown, European</p><p></p><div align="left" style="padding-bottom:6px; padding-top:14px; border-top:1px
