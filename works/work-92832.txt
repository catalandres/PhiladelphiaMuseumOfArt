<div id="recordData"><p><i><strong>Sampler: Embroidered Picture</strong></i></p><p>Hungry chicks in a central nest are fed by enormous birds, attended by a variety of smaller birds and butterflies.  A profusion of flowers with colored outlines and serrate leaves arise from spindly trunks.  Below, on an abstract patchwork of paving stones, a flock of sheep is between a boy with a dog and a girl at a well in front of a house.</p><p>Made by Caroline E. Bieber, American, 1827 - 1885.
